// Version Control with Git //

1. In the project directory, first initialize git with your terminal by typing git init. This creates a hidden git
folder that tracks changes. You will not see this folder in explorer but you can see it by typing "ls -a" in your terminal.


2. To keep track of changes of files in our directory, we must add the file to our staging directory. We can track files
that git is monitoring using the "git status" command. Any file that is green is being tracked by git. To add a file to
the staging directory, we must type "add filename.fileextension" 

3. When your files are added to the staging area, you can make a commit by typing "$git commit -m "commit message"".
NOTE: It is best practice to write your commit message in present tense, and for all projects these messages should
be somewhat thoughful so if you have to rollback, you'll know exactly where you should roll back to.
